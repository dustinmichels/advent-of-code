My song's contagious
My fear is gone

Rock the city
Our dreams are us

While the city is smaller than our dreams,
Listen to your heart
If it is silent
Rock the city with your heart
If my song's greater than my fear
Let my fear be my song

Let my song be nothing

If your heart ain't wrong
Roll the city
Cast your heart into the crowd
Let my song be with them


Music takes me
Put me into the wind
Whisper the wind

Music taking my fear
