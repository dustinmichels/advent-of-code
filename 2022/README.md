# Advent of Code (2022)

[Challenges](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

## Log

**Day 1 || Counting calories [Rockstar]** - I loved learning Rockstar. It was weirdly difficult to distinguish between an empty line and EOF while reading input.

**Day 2 || Rock, paper scissors [Python]** - Clunky, not so impressive... just trying to keep up!

**Day 3 || Sorting rucksacks [Racket]** - cons! car! cdr! I really liked revisiting scheme, which I haven't used since my undergrad. Very odd, but also elegant!

**Day 4 || Overlapping ranges [Go]** - Yep.

**Day 5 || Moving crates [TypeScript]** - The hardest part is parsing the initial input... I tried out Bun to get TypeScript up and running quickly, and I was pleased and impressed!

**Day 6 || Radio signals [Python]** - Pretty simple. I initially tried parsing the input recursively and encountered a "recursive limit exceeded error" in Python, which connected nicely to my review of Racket/Scheme during Day 3, where I read about "tail call optimization". Ah, right! That's what it means! My recursive solution would have worked in a language with tail call optimization, but not in Python.

**Day 7 || Filesystem parsing [Python]** - Much harder than expected! I like the tree solution I eventually came to, but made a lot of mistakes along the way... I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to print my tree/nodes nicely for debugging, before realizing I could just use a debugger...

**Day 8 || Treehouse scouting [Go]** - I am proud of my part 1 solution! I think it's $O(N)$ and could be run in parallel. Unfortunately, it's no help with part 2...

**Day 9 || Rope "physics" [Go]** - More go practice.
